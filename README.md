This is a advance password manager , you can run on your terminal
It sucks having to remember all the passwords you create on different online platforms,
some take time to help you when you have forgetten your password, so this tool will not only help save your passwords ,but it will encrypt them for incase someone steals your password file.
Isn't that cool?, yeah! try it out and tell what you think.
